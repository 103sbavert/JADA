# JADA (Just Another Dictionary App)  

A simple and small dictionary that supports multiple languages, namely, Hindi, English, French, Spanish, Russian, Turkish, German, Japenese, Italian, and Korean.

The dictionary was made a clean architecture and ease of reading the code in mind.

It uses Kotlin entirely and it uses Navigation Components and parts of the MVVM architecture components.

It uses Retrofit2 to access a webserver through a RESTApi to retrieve information about the word entered by the user in the search bar and to show the results it uses a scroll view.

It also uses Material Components throughout the app wherever possible. This app can be used by absolute beginners as a way to learn some basic things like using ViewModels or LiveData or Material Components.

I have commented every piece of code that I believed is part of common things you do in Android Development. All the logic and operations done by me that are common practices and unique to this particular app were explained with comments. There can be parts that could use some improvement since I by no means claim to be a perfectly skilled or experienced developer, in fact, I am relative to so many awesome developers out there, I am very much new. I would like to get suggestions to improve my code or app from other experiened developers.
